      <p className="mb-4 p-justify">
        At Piano Professional, my mission is to provide exceptional piano
        education that empowers students to achieve their musical goals and
        develop a lifelong passion for music.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 p-justify">
        With my extensive experience as a professional piano teacher, including
        a background in DMA in Collaborative Piano from the University of
        Maryland and an MM in Collaborative Piano from The Juilliard School, I
        am committed to the highest standards of excellence and the cultivation
        of artistic expression. My teaching philosophy is rooted in the
        following principles:

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Individualized Instruction</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 p-justify">
            I recognize that every student is unique, with different
            aspirations, learning styles, and musical backgrounds. Drawing from
            my experience as a Music Staff and Performance Pianist at renowned
            opera companies such as Opera Theatre Saint Louis, Opera San Jose,
            and San Francisco Opera, I tailor my lessons to meet the specific
            needs and goals of each student, ensuring a personalized learning
            experience.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Technical Mastery</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 p-justify">
            I believe in building a strong foundation of technical skills, which
            serves as the bedrock for artistic expression. Leveraging my
            expertise as a Vocal Coach, Staff Pianist, and Chamber Music Coach,
            I provide focused attention on proper technique, finger dexterity,
            and coordination, guiding my students towards achieving mastery and
            fluidity in their playing.

        <li className="mb-2">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Artistic Interpretation</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 p-justify">
            Music is an art form that transcends technicality. Drawing from my
            experiences as an Adler Fellow and Vocal Coach at San Francisco
            Opera and my collaborations in recitals and festivals such as SF
            Performance Recitals and The Song Continues at Carnegie Hall, I
            encourage my students to delve into the nuances of musical
            interpretation, fostering their musicality and sensitivity. By
            exploring various musical styles and genres, I nurture their ability
            to express their unique artistic voice.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Musical Understanding</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 p-justify">
            I believe that a comprehensive understanding of music theory is
            crucial for musicianship. Building upon my experience as a Music
            Staff, Vocal Coach, and Pit Pianist at Maryland Opera Studio and San
            Francisco Conservatory of Music, I guide my students in developing a
            solid theoretical foundation, enabling them to comprehend the
            structure, harmony, and rhythm of music. This knowledge empowers
            them to interpret and perform with depth and understanding.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Inspiring Creativity</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 p-justify">
            I foster an environment that nurtures creativity and encourages my
            students to explore their musical potential. As a Faculty member at
            Santa Clara Chamber Music and with my experience at Aspen Music
            Festival and School, I inspire them to compose their own music,
            experiment with improvisation, and develop their unique artistic
            ideas. I believe that creative expression is vital for personal
            growth and fulfillment as a musician.

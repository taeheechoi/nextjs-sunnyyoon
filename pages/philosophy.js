        At Piano Professional, my mission is to provide exceptional piano
        education that empowers students to achieve their musical goals and
        develop a lifelong passion for music. With extensive experience as a
        professional piano teacher and a background in DMA in Collaborative
        Piano from the University of Maryland and an MM in Collaborative Piano
        from The Juilliard School, I am committed to excellence and the
        cultivation of artistic expression. My teaching philosophy is rooted in
        the following principles:

          <h2 className="text-lg font-bold">Individualized Instruction</h2>
          <p className="mb-4 p-justify">
            Every student is unique, with different aspirations, learning
            styles, and musical backgrounds. I tailor my lessons to meet the
            specific needs and goals of each student, ensuring a personalized
            learning experience. Drawing from my experience as a Music Staff and
            Performance Pianist at renowned opera companies such as Opera
            Theatre Saint Louis, Opera San Jose, and San Francisco Opera, I
            provide customized instruction.

          <h2 className="text-lg font-bold">Technical Mastery</h2>
          <p className="mb-4 p-justify">
            I believe in building a strong foundation of technical skills, which
            serves as the bedrock for artistic expression. With expertise as a
            Vocal Coach, Staff Pianist, and Chamber Music Coach, I provide
            focused attention on proper technique, finger dexterity, and
            coordination, guiding students towards achieving mastery and
            fluidity in their playing.

        <li className="mb-2">
          <h2 className="text-lg font-bold">Artistic Interpretation</h2>
          <p className="mb-4 p-justify">
            Music is an art form that transcends technicality. Drawing from my
            experiences as an Adler Fellow and Vocal Coach at San Francisco
            Opera, as well as collaborations in recitals and festivals such as
            SF Performance Recitals and The Song Continues at Carnegie Hall, I
            encourage students to delve into the nuances of musical
            interpretation, fostering their musicality and sensitivity. By
            exploring various musical styles and genres, I nurture their ability
            to express their unique artistic voice.

          <h2 className="text-lg font-bold">Musical Understanding</h2>
          <p className="mb-4 p-justify">
            A comprehensive understanding of music theory is crucial for
            musicianship. Building upon my experience as a Music Staff, Vocal
            Coach, and Pit Pianist at Maryland Opera Studio and San Francisco
            Conservatory of Music, I guide students in developing a solid
            theoretical foundation, enabling them to comprehend the structure,
            harmony, and rhythm of music. This knowledge empowers them to
            interpret and perform with depth and understanding.

          <h2 className="text-lg font-bold">Inspiring Creativity</h2>
          <p className="mb-4 p-justify">
            I foster an environment that nurtures creativity and encourages
            students to explore their musical potential. As a Faculty member at
            Santa Clara Chamber Music and with experience at Aspen Music
            Festival and School, I inspire them to compose their own music,
            experiment with improvisation, and develop their unique artistic
            ideas. I believe that creative expression is vital for personal
            growth and fulfillment as a musician.

        I am dedicated to providing a supportive and engaging learning

        strive to ignite a lifelong love for music and guide them towards
        becoming well-rounded, expressive, and accomplished pianists.
